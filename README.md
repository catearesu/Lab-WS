This Lab is a bit different: instead of filling a document, you will have to create one of your own! In this lab, you will have to create a Jupyter Notebook where you scrap everytime is executed the updated Billboard Hot 100 songs (URL) and return a dataframe with 100 rows (duh) and the following columns:

Song
Artist
Last Week Rank
Weeks On Chart
It will also be nice if the document presented is in a function. Even nicer if it is a .py file.
